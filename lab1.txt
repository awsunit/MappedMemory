2. Main is at 0xffffffff80104f05, gdb does not work with physical address.
3. OSV maps the kernel and user-application into the same address space so when
   a user invokes a system call, the kernelâ€™s system call code can directly
   refer to user memory.
4. Malloc is used for a user process to allocate heap space. Kmalloc is for the
   kernel to allocate kernel memory. Calls to kmalloc returns a kernel virtual address that you can access directly. Printf allows a user process to print to the
   stdout provided by OSV while the kernel uses kprintf to print to stdout
   provided by qemu.
